1
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,540
Magic.

2
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,870
At the beginning of the 21st century,
it was categorized by actual technique.

3
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,910
Those who possess superior abilities are known
as "magic technicians" or "magicians"...

4
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,490
and are placed
under the care of various nations.

5
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,620
Among them, magicians
with the power to repel an army

6
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,660
and destroy a major city in one strike
were labeled "Strategic-Class magicians,"

7
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,330
and became the symbol of a military force
that influences world affairs.

8
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,700
Then, October 31st, 2095.

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,410
Unofficial Strategic-Class magic...

10
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,240
wiped out a naval base and a fleet
on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,080
That day became known
as "Scorched Halloween."

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,410
The world was shaken by the debut
of a new Strategic-Class magician.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,380
December 23rd, 2095 Dallas, Texas, USNA

14
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,080
Halt!

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,910
Lieutenant Alfred Fomalhaut!

16
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,080
You know there's no escape.

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,490
What the hell happened, Freddy?

18
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,410
You were given the first-magnitude code name.

19
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,410
What would make you desert the unit?

20
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,450
You've also been accused
of using your pyrokinesis

21
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,910
to commit a series of
arson-murders in this town.

22
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,950
You didn't really do that,
though, did you?

23
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,660
Freddy!

24
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,580
Please answer me!

25
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,240
Pyrokinesis!

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,490
Lieutenant Fomalhaut...

27
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,490
Based on the special articles of the USNA
Army Criminal Law Special Provision,

28
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,700
with the authority
of the commander of Stars...

29
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,240
I hereby sentence you to death!

30
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,580
RESERVED TODAY

31
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,830
December 24th, 2095

32
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,580
Does everyone have a drink?

33
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,240
This doesn't seem like quite
the layout for a farewell party,

34
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,950
but they did prepare a cake for us, too.

35
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,290
So, let's have a toast with this phrase.

36
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,330
Merry Christmas.

37
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,200
Merry Christmas!

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,990
Cheers!

39
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,840
Cheers.

40
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,080
Yep.

41
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,080
I still can't believe...

42
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,040
that you're going to study abroad
in America, Shizuku.

43
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,620
It's like that came out of nowhere.

44
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,490
Sorry. My father wouldn't let me
talk about it until now, the last minute.

45
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,160
But I'm surprised you're allowed to go.

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,540
They usually don't give magicians
permission to travel abroad.

47
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,660
For some reason, they're letting me go.

48
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,870
According to my father,
the reason is it's a foreign exchange program.

49
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,040
How long will you be gone?
And when do you leave?

50
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,120
At the beginning of the New Year.
It's for three months.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,540
Oh, three months!

52
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,490
Where in America are you going?

53
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,870
Here!

54
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,830
Berkeley.

55
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,620
Not Boston, then.

56
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,580
I guess the East Coast
is unstable these days.

57
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,950
Oh yeah, aren't the humanists
making some stink?

58
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,540
It's on the news a lot.

59
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,330
First witch hunts, now magician hunts?

60
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,450
They say history repeats,
but this is just silly.

61
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:33,370
So, do you know
who's coming here in your place?

62
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,490
I heard she's a girl my age.

63
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,920
Stars Base, Texas, USNA

64
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,790
Come in.

65
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,080
Excuse me, Commander.
I brought you some milk tea.

66
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,490
Ben!

67
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,410
Thank you.

68
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,950
You're welcome.

69
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,200
By the way, Commander,
do you have everything ready?

70
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,950
Yes, pretty much.

71
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:30,580
Well, for a while, forget about
your duties and just let your hair down.

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,870
It isn't vacation.
I'll be on a special mission.

73
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,580
In fact, I'm anxious about it.

74
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,080
I have to find the suspected
Strategic-Class magician.

75
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,700
Why me, when I'm not used to
undercover investigations?

76
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,040
I know my age is a good match for it,

77
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,700
but there are a lot of people
who've gone through specialized training.

78
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,910
Okay, okay.

79
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,950
If the target is whom we suspect,
it's a Strategic-Class magician

80
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,240
who's responsible
for Scorched Halloween.

81
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,040
Someone even more dangerous
than a nuclear missile.

82
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,870
I can see why the General Staff Office

83
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,080
would prioritize fighting
strength over training as a spy

84
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,620
when making their choice.

85
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,120
I get that, but...

86
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,240
Why not think about it like this?

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,790
The commander's duty

88
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,870
is making contact with the suspect
and trying to throw them off balance.

89
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,410
Well, I guess that's about right.

90
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,490
Since my spycraft is pretty much
on the same level as an amateur.

91
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,040
Then, even more so, I think it's your loss
if you don't enjoy yourself there.

92
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,830
I believe that would get any suspects
to let their guard down around you, too.

93
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,370
Yes. You may have a point there, Ben.

94
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,740
Ben, watch the fort while I'm gone.

95
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,330
There are fugitives
who still haven't been punished yet,

96
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,540
and normally, tracking
them down would be my duty,

97
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,080
so I hate having to make you do it, but...

98
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,660
You're the only I can trust
to take over my duties here, so...

99
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,120
You can count on me, Commander.

100
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,870
You're not leaving just yet,
but have a safe trip.

101
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,910
"SHIBA"

102
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,910
December 31st, 2095

103
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,490
Understood, Aunt.
I'll talk to you later.

104
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,160
Oh, that's right, Tatsuya...

105
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,290
Yes?

106
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,910
The USNA Army Magician Unit Stars

107
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,700
is searching for the Strategic-Class magician
who let loose Material Burst.

108
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,330
Watch your back, Tatsuya.

109
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,830
Understood.

110
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,740
Well, Happy New Year.

111
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,120
January 1st, 2096

112
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,910
Isn't Miyuki beautiful?

113
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,240
Happy New Year, Tatsuya!

114
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,990
That really suits you!

115
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,990
Happy New Year.

116
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,120
That looks good on you, too, Honoka.

117
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,410
You were born to wear that, Tatsuya.

118
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,450
You've got the presence of
a leader of a crime syndicate.

119
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,330
What, I'm yakuza?

120
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,830
Tatsuya...

121
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,790
Who's that?

122
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,790
Master Yakumo,
the head priest of Kyuchoji Temple.

123
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:43,040
Maybe you know him better as the famous
ninjutsu user, Master Yakumo Kokonoe.

124
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,330
He's my martial arts teacher.

125
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,450
Nice to meet you.

126
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,290
Tatsuya, do you know who that is?

127
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,410
No idea.

128
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,910
Maybe to a foreigner,
your manner of dress is unusual, Tatsuya.

129
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,120
Brother, what are you looking at?

130
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,450
She's pretty.

131
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,740
Not as much as you, though.

132
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,040
Don't think you can always
throw me off the trail like that.

133
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,240
I'm not trying to throw you off the trail.

134
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,830
I really think that.

135
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,370
And that's not why I'm looking at her.

136
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,040
Is there something suspicious about her?

137
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,740
Suspicious...

138
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,290
Well, that outfit is rather peculiar.

139
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,290
But that's not all, is it?

140
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,410
Welcome home!

141
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,370
Silvie, you're back already?

142
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,580
Silvie?

143
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,790
Lina...

144
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,790
Why are you dressed like that?

145
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,910
Oh, this?

146
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,740
Not wanting to stand out,

147
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,290
I looked into appropriate
Japanese fashion for visiting a shrine.

148
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,080
It took longer than I thought.

149
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,330
Does it look good?

150
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,790
Before I answer that,
let me ask you something.

151
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,080
Sure, what is it?

152
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,580
Did you see any other girls
who were dressed like you at the shrine?

153
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,910
Huh? Now that you mention it,
I don't recall seeing anyone.

154
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,620
Lina, I'm going to be frank with you!

155
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,740
That outfit shows a lack of common sense!

156
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,830
Don't be surprised!

157
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,040
The only place I might see an outfit
like that is in sketchy anime or comics!

158
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,200
Where did you get the idea from?

159
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,700
I bet everyone was gawking
at you and that eyesore!

160
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,580
Come to think of it,
the target did smirk at me.

161
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,120
Commander, let's cancel
the rest of your itinerary for today.

162
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,740
I'm going to carefully explain
modern Japanese fashion trends to you

163
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,580
in a way

164
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,200
that you'll understand.

165
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,910
Okay.

166
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,080
"Visitor Arc I"

167
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,790
January 9th, 2096

168
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,660
"NATIONAL MAGIC UNIVERSITY
AFFILIATED FIRST HIGH SCHOOL"

169
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,990
Sorry to keep you waiting.

170
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,790
That's the magic girl we saw at the shrine.

171
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,950
Shush.

172
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,990
I'll introduce you, Tatsuya.

173
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,410
This is Angelina Kudou Shields.

174
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,450
She's the exchange student and will be
our classmate in Class A starting today.

175
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:27,370
Honoka, I'd like you to introduce me
to everyone, not just him.

176
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,660
Oh, sorry!

177
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,700
Well, that's Honoka for you.

178
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,660
It's so Honoka.

179
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,740
Then, let's start over.

180
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,580
This is Angelina Kudou Shields
from America.

181
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,870
Please call me Lina.

182
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,160
Nice to meet you.

183
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,950
Nice to meet you, Lina.

184
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,660
Are you related to His Excellency Kudou?

185
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:01,240
I seem to recall that his younger brother
settled in America and raised a family there.

186
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,910
Oh, you're well-informed!
That was a long time ago,

187
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,120
but my mother's grandfather
is General Kudou's younger brother.

188
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,740
It seems that connection is part of
the reason I'm allowed to study here.

189
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,040
Ready, Miyuki?

190
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,620
Whenever you are.

191
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,080
You can do the countdown, Lina.

192
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,870
Three...

193
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,450
two...

194
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,830
one!

195
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,370
Go!

196
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,660
I lost again!

197
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,370
I'm ahead by two, Lina.

198
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,410
They were tied up.

199
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,910
I think the exchange student's
casting was slightly faster.

200
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,370
Yes.

201
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,700
But Miyuki's interference power was superior,

202
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,240
and she grabbed control of
the magic before it was complete.

203
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,450
Prioritize speed or power?
Instead of winning through simple ability...

204
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,660
I'd say she won through strategy.

205
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,370
One more time, Miyuki!

206
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,370
I'll beat you this time!

207
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,950
Brother...

208
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,870
So, is Lina...

209
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,290
Yeah.

210
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,290
There's a high likelihood she's Angie Sirius,
the commander of Stars,

211
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,540
the USNA Army's
most powerful magician unit.

212
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,080
The question is...

213
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:52,660
Why would the USNA send in Sirius
who is essentially their trump card?

214
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Exactly.

215
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,200
After watching her for a week...

216
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,040
I can tell Lina isn't cut out to be a spy.

217
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,540
I would suspect the real spy
to be acting separately,

218
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,490
but Sirius is too important
to use as a cover story.

219
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,370
No, assuming Lina is Sirius,

220
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,540
a spy mission is incidental.
The real mission is something else.

221
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,790
A mission so important
that the USNA would send Sirius overseas.

222
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,870
What could it be?

223
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,790
I have no idea...

224
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,410
what the USNA has in mind.

225
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,910
I'm back!

226
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,660
Welcome home, Lina.

227
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,740
Mia, you're here?

228
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,080
Yes.

229
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,700
I apologize for the intrusion, Major.

230
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,910
Please have a seat, Mia.

231
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,290
Silvie, get us some tea, please.

232
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,080
Milk tea, yes?

233
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,540
Another cup for you, Mia?

234
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,290
Yes. Thank you.

235
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:03,080
Did you learn anything
about the Strategic-Class magician, Silvie?

236
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:10,240
I pored over the entire public database
but didn't find any new information.

237
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Really?

238
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,540
Mia, you're undercover at the Magic University.

239
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,490
Have you heard anything?

240
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,080
Nothing yet.

241
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,580
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,410
How about you, Lina?

243
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,290
Have you gotten friendly
with the target at all?

244
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,240
Yes, I believe we're on good terms,

245
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,080
but I haven't learned anything important.

246
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,040
I have a feeling my cover
will be blown before that.

247
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,910
Has something happened?

248
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,790
Yes, actually...

249
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,980
"School Information"

250
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,240
By the way, Lina...

251
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,450
Yes?

252
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,240
Usually the nickname for Angelina
would be "Angie," wouldn't it?

253
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,580
Or is my memory playing tricks on me?

254
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,620
No, you're right.

255
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,910
Back in elementary school,
there was a girl named Angela in my class,

256
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,910
and everyone called her "Angie."

257
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,700
And that's why you're called
"Lina" instead of "Angie"?

258
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,330
You don't think it was a coincidence?

259
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,200
I don't know.

260
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,790
I really don't.

261
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,160
It's fine! He's just a high school student.

262
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
Even if he does suspect me...

263
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,410
I won't let him trip me up.

264
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,700
Lina...

265
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,790
What are you doing here?

266
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,290
Tatsuya, you're in Course 2, aren't you?

267
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,620
Yes.

268
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,200
I was wondering why your uniform
was different from everyone else's in Class A.

269
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,540
Miyuki explained it to me,
but she didn't sound too happy about it.

270
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,160
But when I asked Honoka
about it afterwards,

271
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,490
she said you were a powerful student
at the top of your first-year class.

272
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,490
Tatsuya, why are you pretending
to be an Irregular?

273
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,830
I'm not pretending.

274
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,410
I really am an Irregular.

275
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,790
For the practical skill test, they grade you
on three things. Speed, scale and strength.

276
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,160
But in a battle,

277
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,330
victory and defeat aren't determined
alone by the merits of those three things.

278
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,540
As far as practical skill tests go,
I'm an Irregular,

279
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,540
but I'm tough in a fight. That's all.

280
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,200
Ability for tests and ability for
actual combat are two different things.

281
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,620
I agree with that opinion.

282
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,620
Instead of a talented student at school,

283
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,620
I'd like to become a magician
who's useful in a fight.

284
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,700
It's like you're spoiling for a fight.

285
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,040
You can tell, can't you? That's impressive.

286
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,910
That was reckless.

287
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,910
I figured you could dodge it.

288
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,370
Will you explain all this?

289
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,990
Will you...

290
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,080
let me go first?

291
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,240
That's pretty painful.

292
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,370
Jeez, that hurt.

293
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,910
You tried to put a hole in my face.

294
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,790
I think it's only natural for you
to get a little pain in exchange.

295
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,990
A clump of Psionic particles is hardly lethal.

296
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,790
At worst, you'd only hallucinate
that you got shot with a gun.

297
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,580
And you don't think I was justified
in getting a little rough blocking it?

298
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,330
Fine. You win.

299
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,830
Please forgive my rudeness, Mr. Tatsuya.

300
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,740
Forget about it.

301
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,120
And you don't need to be polite.

302
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,620
Acting like you're high-class
doesn't feel like the real you, Lina.

303
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,370
How am I not high-class?

304
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,160
Just doesn't fit your personality.

305
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,790
That's not true!

306
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,950
I'll have you know that I was once invited
by the president to have tea!

307
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,660
Oh?

308
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,870
Imagine, only a very few magicians get
to meet the president, and you're one of them.

309
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,080
Well, whatever.

310
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,450
You wanted to try my skill, Lina.
Is that what it was about?

311
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,370
Y-Yes.

312
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,490
It was simple curiosity.

313
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,620
Then, your curiosity is satisfied.

314
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,160
Don't test me again.

315
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,240
Aren't you going to ask me?

316
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,410
Ask you what?

317
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,240
Ask me what?

318
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,080
Aren't you going to ask about
who I really am or something like that?

319
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,580
I don't care.

320
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,080
There are things in this world
you're better off not knowing about.

321
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,740
You're a jerk.

322
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,990
Lina! Wake up!

323
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,870
It's Major Canopus! There's an emergency!

324
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,950
Ben, what's wrong?

325
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,120
We found out the location
of the fugitives last month.

326
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,700
What?

327
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,450
Where are they?

328
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,870
Japan.

329
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,410
We believe they made landfall in Yokohama
and are currently laying low in Tokyo.

330
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,450
Why Japan?

331
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,080
Why Tokyo?

332
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,370
The Joint Chiefs of Staff have decided
to dispatch more pursuers.

333
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,660
Does the Japanese government
know about this?

334
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,870
No, it's a secret operation.

335
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,540
Commander, I'm going to relay
your orders from the General Staff Office.

336
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,790
"The mission given to Major Angie Sirius
should now be her second priority.

337
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,910
Her first priority is
to track down the fugitives."

338
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,240
Understood. Please relay that to headquarters.

339
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Roger that. Be careful, Commander.

340
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,990
"Visitor Arc"

341
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,040
"Visitor Arc II"
